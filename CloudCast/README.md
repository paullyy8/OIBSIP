## Getting Started with CloudCast üå§Ô∏è
### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the CloudCast repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/paullyy8/OIBSIP.git
cd OIBSIP/CloudCast
```

### 2. Install Required Packages
Next, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create an API Key
To fetch weather data, you need an API key from OpenWeatherMap:
- Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid) and sign up for a free account.
- After logging in, generate your API key.

### 4. Store Your API Key Securely
Create a `.env` file in the project directory to store your API key securely. Add the following line to the `.env` file:
```
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
Make sure to replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key.

### 5. Ensure the `.env` File is Ignored
To prevent your API key from being shared, ensure that your `.env` file is included in the `.gitignore`.

### 6. Run the Application
Now you‚Äôre ready to run the CloudCast application! Use the following command:
```bash
python script.py
```

## Usage
1. **Enter a Location**: Type in the name of the city for which you want weather data.
2. **View Results**: Get real-time updates on temperature, humidity, and forecast.
3. **Explore Features**: Additional options for extended weather data and forecast.
