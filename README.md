# Introduction

This repository contains the Python projects I have developed during my internship at [Oasis Infobyte](https://oasisinfobyte.com/). All the projects are built using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter).  
I’ve designed both CLI (Command Line Interface) and GUI (Graphical User Interface) versions for users, giving them flexibility in how they interact with the tools.

For those who prefer working in the terminal, the CLI versions are lightweight and efficient.  
For users who prefer a more interactive experience, I've also built GUI applications using Tkinter.
