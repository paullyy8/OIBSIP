  <h3>Python Developer Internship</h3>
  <h4>Oct 2024 - Nov 2024</h4>
</div>

Welcome to my collection of Python projects developed during my internship at [Oasis Infobyte](https://oasisinfobyte.com/).

Each project is available in two versions:

- **CLI (Command-Line Interface)**: Lightweight and efficient for terminal-based users.
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: Interactive and user-friendly, designed with Tkinter for a rich visual experience.

I’ve built these projects to help users accomplish specific tasks with ease while offering flexibility in usage. Whether you prefer working in the terminal or a graphical interface, there’s something for everyone.
